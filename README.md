`npm install`
`npm run storybook`

### Few notes of the coding experience:
The search input is there - it searches in the array that it has available, though currently the array is just hard-coded and not dynamic 

I never got super far as I ran into **a lot of issues**.
Things that are missing are the dropdown to show up properly, and I lack basically all the bonus points.

I wanted to prioritize functionality, however in general I never really got far into that due to the issues I ran into.

I wish I had been trying to take smaller steps at a time, because **I didnt know Lit or storybook at all**! I guess you could say I shouldve prioritized my own learning more rather than just trying to get it to work.

As I had some major issues with it, it was first when I slowed down, and tried to take smaller steps (learn storybook only and ignore lit and the library, followed by learning Lit without storybook) that I started to make some progress. I finally got Lit and storybook to work together after having used up almost all the time I had.

Then I ran into more issues regarding Lit and Typescript. It didnt want to set my properties in the class, i kept getting compiling errors etc, and there is still some errors showing up if you look at the files that I wasnt able to look into because time is now up.
